Hyperflyer's business site now leverages [Gatsbyâ€™s](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) static site generation for performance, scalability, and security. In combination with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), [Gatsby plugins](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/), [GraphQL](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/graphql/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and Material-UI, the website is built based on company provided designs.

It is mindfully designed with general best practices including performance, accessibility, SEO, offline support, and responsive to any screen size/device/browser.
