At first they were small projects to get my understanding. Things like tic-tac-toe or a weather app. Nothing particularly creative, but something that helps me get more grounded in the \"fundamentals\" of what I was learning via resources such as freecodecamp and online tutorials.</p>\n<p>I started to take on bigger projects, things that were more complicated, things that started to take me weeks to complete. I ended up getting burnt out and feeling discouraged.</p>\n<p>Recently Dev.to posted a GitHub Actions Hackathon and my husband and I decided to code it together. He coded the back-end, I coded the front-end. So what did I learn?</p>\n<h1>Don't fear the blank canvas.</h1>\n<h1>Love your documentation.</h1>\n<h1>Go for MVP.</h1>\n<p>But on something you're interested in.\nWhat's next?</p>\n<p>The main things I've learned so far is that actually trying to build a \"thing\" has taught me far more than either exercises, or imitating an existing project that is structured a particular way. Learning by example was definitely the fastest way to get started, but I really picked up steam once I overcame the \"fear of the blank canvas\" and just learned to rely heavily on legitimate documentation (e.g. MDN) instead of trying to learn from random code snippets/tutorials online. So far, I've picked up just HTML, CSS, React, JavaScript, and now a little TypeScript. I'm constantly blown away with how much you can create without knowing a lot, if you're able to just combine what you already know creatively. So don't be intimidated if much of the material out there seems foreign and \"scary\" (as a lot of it still does for me). I'm convinced that someone new would be able to create what I've recently made with far less knowledge than you would think. Sure it may not be \"optimal\" or \"perfect,\" but that's what iteration is for, right? :)</p>\n<p>As for the thing I \"shipped,\" it's really early stages (and probably has a lot of things I can improve on), but I built it with people like myself in mind and hope others might benefit from it. The site is <a href=\"https://moreeyesplz.com/\">https://moreeyesplz.com/</a> (note: my husband built the backend, but I did the frontend, I swear!). As for what it is, it's a simple way to crowdsource feedback on commits you commit to GitHub. We actually created it for the Dev.to GitHub actions hackathon project, but felt it might be worth sharing as it's also my first shipped project. It's free as in beer (that's free), and we honestly have no idea if others in the community will even take to it. That said, my husband has offered to give as much feedback/mentorship as he has time available there (and I think people should take him up on it!).</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"What My First Project Taught Me","date":"Oct 05, 2020","quote":"You canâ€™t be that kid standing at the top of the waterslide, overthinking it.
