Up until recently, I was growing my career as an HR systems professional. I enjoyed the different aspects of HRIS (Human Resources Information Systems) and the team even more so. However, as time passed, it became evident that I was encroaching on system limitations and spending days waiting on future product updates.</br></br>\n<p>Our team's needs were not being met by the system we were using. It was increasingly frusterating to be building wonky workarounds and frankensteining products to deliver solutions. When I turned back to the thought of becoming an engineer, I saw it as an opportunity to gain more autonomy and hopefully grow into a career that would constantly challenge me and stay \"interesting\".</p>\n<p>Initially, I opted to enroll in a bootcamp. I felt the structure afforded by such a program would keep me honest and guide my learning. While this was true to an extent, I left because I felt the information and instruction was not the quality I had hoped for. In order to cram all the material advertised in the curriculum into a few short months, the coverage felt superficial and rushed. I found myself often asking \"why\" something was done a particular way, and more often than not, the teaching assistants seemed either not to know, or not to think it was important. This resulting in many additional hours of scraping the internet for additional resources and eventually becoming an unofficial teaching assistant for my own team. After a month, I had decided that bootcamp was unable to fill my needs for the price I was paying and took a \"leap\" of faith to learn coding on my own (with the help and guidance of my fabulous engineering husband - hi hun!).</p>\n<p>The past few months has been an incredible journey of growth and satisfaction. Each time I overcome a bug or implement a new feature, the joy I feel when my project comes together has been indispensible. To my pleasant surprise, there has been many similarites between HRIS and engineering. Like how I can take real world problems and create a technical solution. Or like how I can think critically about how a project should be organized for maintainability, user experience, data integrity, user security, legacy data/systems, and testing/reliability, and so on. However, the differences are what made the career change one I am glad that I had made.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Why I changed careers","description":null,"date":"Oct 01, 2020","quote":"Anyone who stops learning is old, whether at twenty or eighty.","quoteAuthor":"Henry Ford","photo":{"publicURL":"/static/dd327162dd67a05e5bbef629c04fdfc1/why-i-changed-careers.jpg"}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts/blog/why-i-changed-careers/"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
