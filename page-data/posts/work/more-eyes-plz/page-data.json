We thought that in the spirit of Dev.to and GitHub's community, that a community-led resource to help people like myself get feedback on GitHub commits would be a great submission.</p>\n<p>The website design was mainly inspired from the Hackathon sponsors <a href=\"https://dev.to/\">Dev.to</a>, as a tribute to their Hackathon. However, more minor design choices can also noted from other community-led sites such as <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/\">Reddit</a>, <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/\">Stack Overflow</a>, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/\">Twitter</a>. With the help of the art from <a href=\"https://undraw.co/illustrations\">unDraw</a>, the website was brought to life.</p>\n<p>I was responsible for the frontend, which is built as a single page application with <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/\">React</a>, <a href=\"https://www.typescriptlang.org/\">TypeScript</a>, and <a href=\"https://material-ui.com/\">Material-UI</a>. It queries the \"meeps\" database (hosted using the issue tracker of a GitHub repo), fetches labels/tags, and enables tag-based searching using the fetch API and OAuth credentials to pull data from Github.</p>\n<p>Jeremy was responsible for the backend for <a href=\"https://moreeyesplz.com/\">More Eyes, Plz!</a>, which runs almost completely off Github by leveraging actions. The <a href=\"https://github.com/marketplace/actions/meep-scanner\">MEEP Scanner</a> runs on every push. For each commit that contains \"[MEEP]\", the commit metadata is sent to a Google Cloud Function. The cloud function dispatches another action (called the <a href=\"https://github.com/moreeyesplz/meeper\">\"meeper\"</a>) on a central repository, forwarding along the commit metadata as inputs by POSTing a workflow_dispatch event. The meeper action uses Github app credentials associated with a bot we built called <a href=\"https://github.com/moreeyesplz/themeepbot\">themeepbot</a>. The action authors a comment on the issuing commit and also creates an issue on the <a href=\"https://github.com/moreeyesplz/meeps\">meeps repository</a>. The website uses the Github REST API to query and search for issues, presenting them to users in a digestible way. All components of the service (actions, website, tracker, bot) are <a href=\"https://github.com/moreeyesplz\">open-sourced</a> for the community to learn and benefit from.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"More Eyes Plz!","description":"A simple way to crowdsource feedback on your GitHub commits","date":"2020","tools":"React, TypeScript, Material-UI","link":"https://moreeyesplz.com/","photo":{"publicURL":"/static/839847bf1f2b0940c78a69f04c3b0468/meep.png"},"coverPhoto":{"publicURL":"/static/8943b21ecd58f47b53d5935bd4294ffa/meep.png"}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts/work/more-eyes-plz/"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
