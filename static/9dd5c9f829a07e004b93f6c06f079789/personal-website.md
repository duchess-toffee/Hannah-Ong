The design was inspired after a week of research. Using Google searches and [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/) images for inspiration, I crafted this design using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/).

The site is built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), [Gatsby plugins](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/), [GraphQL](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/graphql/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and Material-UI. It is designed with general best practices for performance, accessibility, SEO, offline support, and is responsive to any screen size/device/browser.
