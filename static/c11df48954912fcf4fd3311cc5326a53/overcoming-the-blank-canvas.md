<h1 style="display:inline">T</h1>wo months ago, I shipped my first <a href="https://moreeyesplz.com/">thing</a>. Two weeks later, I shipped my next <a href="https://github.com/duchess-toffee/squidy/">thing</a>. A month later I shipped my first <a href="https://business.hyperflyer.com/">website</a> for a startup. So in the month and a half of building projects, what have I learned?</br></br>

To answer that, let's take a step back. When I started coding, I spent my first few months following online tutorials and projects. At first I started with [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/). Shortly afterwards I followed [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/). I created small projects of things that already existed-like a [morse code generator](https://github.com/duchess-toffee/morse_code), [tic-tac-toe](https://github.com/duchess-toffee/tic_tac_toe), a [weather app](https://github.com/duchess-toffee/weather_station); things that didn't take more than a few days. I read some books like [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/), I watched some videos on YouTube, I did some [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)-all the things I thought I needed to know to get a general base understanding of Web Development.

Don't get me wrong. I'm glad I learned the things I did, and I'm grateful that I live in a generation where there are so many free resources to learn from. But "tutorial hell" is infamous for a reason. I found that I was absorbing less through tutorials as time went on. The problem with tutorials and structured lessons is that the environment is made in such a way that will almost always guide you to an intended answer to demonstrate the concept they're trying to teach. It's a great way to learn a general concept, framework, or tool, but what it rarely teaches you is how to make decisions or how to debug.

# Don't fear the blank canvas.

So with the motivation of a [hackathon](https://dev.to/devteam/announcing-the-github-actions-hackathon-on-dev-3ljn), I built my [first website](https://moreeyesplz.com/) in a weekend with [my husband](https://github.com/jeremyong). This was the first project I did from a "blank canvas". It was made from scratch using [React.js](https://reactjs.org/), and it was the first time I started making coding decisions. I had to think about how I wanted to organize my code, my components, my files. I had to decide which plugins and additional tools I wanted for my project. Did I want to create my own components? Did I want to use a UI framework? Did I want to use [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/), [Blueprint.js](https://blueprintjs.com/), or something else? These decisions were incredibly empowering and I believe that being able to justify each of those decisions has made me a better engineer.

# Love your documentation.

Another thing tutorials don't do is emphasize the importance of official documentation. When I first started to learn how to code, tutorials were easier to digest, as they were structured to give you just the content you need. However now I find myself defaulting to documentation. Whether it's MDN or the documentation provided from the toolkit/framework, the documentation helps me understand terminology, how the code/product is structured, and the intended use/limitations of the product.

# Do the Pre-Work

The fastest way to burn yourself out is to not prioritize. Although I have a handful of projects completed, I have another batch of unfinished projects just sitting on my hard drive. The main difference? A lack of process and prioritization.

Now before I start coding, I spend the time to create a design or document. This allows me to code towards something concrete. I'm not changing code on the fly because the UI/UX feels unsatisfactory, and I'm not adding random features because I had a stroke of inspiration. When something does come up, because I did my pre-work I'm easily able to prioritize whether something needs to be added or if it can wait for a separate iteration.

# Summary

The main things I've learned so far is that actually trying to build a "thing" has taught me far more than either exercises, or imitating an existing project that is structured a particular way. Learning by example was definitely the fastest way to get started, but I really picked up steam once I overcame the "fear of the blank canvas" and just learned to rely heavily on legitimate documentation (e.g. MDN) instead of trying to learn from random code snippets/tutorials online. So far, I've picked up just HTML, CSS, React, JavaScript, and now a little TypeScript. I'm constantly blown away with how much you can create without knowing a lot, if you're able to just combine what you already know creatively. So don't be intimidated if much of the material out there seems foreign and "scary" (as a lot of it still does for me). I'm convinced that someone new would be able to create what I've recently made with far less knowledge than you would think. Sure it may not be "optimal" or "perfect," but that's what iteration is for, right?
